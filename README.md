# Binomial Option Pricing Model


This is a notebook about the Binomial Options Pricing model. We formulate the model, give examples and explore the limiting behavior as the size of the interval becomes smaller. We demonstrate the relation with the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. The main reference is "Introduction to the Mathematics of Finance" by Steven Roman (2nd Edition, Springer, 2012).
